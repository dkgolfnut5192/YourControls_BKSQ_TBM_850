# Made for MSFS2020 and not validated for 2024

Profile to work with YourControls application and MSFS2020. If you find any bugs, please contact me on YourControls Discord: Dkgolfnut_Dennis

# Known Issues:
 - AP MAster button and AP NAV buttons are not synchronized due to the BKSQ developer using Ovars. ** These two buttons will need to be pushed manually to ensure the planes are in the same state **

# FIXED: 
Nothing noted yet

I recommend that you and your co-pilot first conduct a test flight to check if everything is working properly.
